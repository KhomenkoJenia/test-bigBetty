          final and not subject to any right of appeal. We will notify you by
          email as to whether or not your Affiliate Application has been
          successful. You will provide any documentation required by Bigbetty to
          verify the Affiliate Application and / or to verify the Affiliate

          measures to ensure that) your log in details for your Affiliate

          unauthorised use of your Affiliate Account resulting from your failure
          to adequately guard your log in information shall be your sole
          responsibility and you remain solely responsible and liable for all
          activity and conduct occurring under you Affiliate Account user ID and
          password whether such activity and / or conduct was undertaken by you

          details are confidential, we do not have visibility of this

          not attempt to benefit from traffic not generated in good faith

          applicable law and appears and functions as a professional website.
          You will not present the Affiliate Website in such a way so that the
          Affiliate Website may cause confusion with the Bigbetty generally or

          Bigbetty. The Affiliate Website will not contain any defamatory,
          libelous, discriminatory, obscene, unlawful (including that which the

          practice in any territory or any jurisdiction where such Affiliate

          compliance by specific performance, injunction, or other equitable
          remedy. Nothing contained in the Affiliate Agreement shall limit or
          affect any of our rights at law, or otherwise, for a breach or

        <h2>6. COMMISSION AND PAYMENT</h2>
        <p>
          6.1 Subject to your adherence with the provisions of the Affiliate
          Agreement, you will earn Commission in accordance with the Commission
          Structure on Net Revenue of New Customers referred by you to the
          Bigbetty Websites. We retain the right to change the Commission
          percentage and method of calculation of Commission as we wish in
          accordance with this clause 6. The Commission shall be deemed to be
          exclusive of value added tax or any other applicable tax.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.2 The Commission is calculated at the end of each month and payments
          shall be made on a monthly basis in arrears, not later than the 25th
          day of the following calendar month, provided that the amount due
          exceeds â¬100 (the âMinimum Thresholdâ) and the amount is not subject
          for further approval. If the balance due is less than the Minimum
          Threshold, it shall be accumulated and carried over to the following
          month and shall be payable when the total Commission collectively
          exceeds the Minimum Threshold. The payment period may be extended in
          case some fraudulent activity is found. In this situation Bigbetty
          reserves the right to conduct a detailed investigation.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.2.1. If the Affiliate claims the Commission after the 6 (six) months
          from the date of occurrence of this Commission, Bigbetty reserves the
          right to pay this Commission within 6 (six) month after the receiving
          of the Affiliate's claim (the whole amount or in parts at the
          discretion of Bigbetty).
        </p>

        <p>
          6.3 Payment of Commission shall be made through the payment method
          which is preferable for the Affiliate company. This method may be
          changed at any time. Due to some governmental regulations, partners
          may be required for verification and âknow your customerâ
          documentation before a withdrawal can be accessed. If an error is made
          in the calculation of the Commission, Bigbetty reserves the right to
          correct such calculation at any time and will immediately pay out
          underpayment or reclaim overpayment made to the Affiliate.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.4 Standard Commission Structures Casino Commission Structure
          calculated on a monthly basis is as following:
        </p>
        New Customers<br />
        Month Affiliate's Commission<br />
        0-5 New Customers 25% of Net Revenue<br />
        6-10 New Customers 30% of Net Revenue<br />
        11-20 New Customers 35% of Net Revenue<br />
        21-40 New Customers 40% of Net Revenue<br />
        41+ New Customers 45% of Net Revenue<br />

        <p>
          6.5 A minimum amount of â¬100 (one hundred euro) may be withdrawn from
          the Affiliate account at any one time.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.6 The Affiliate may, at the sole discretion of Bigbetty, be provided
          with the opportunity to restructure its commission structure. Examples
          of alternative commission structures could include a Cost Per
          Acquisition (CPA) model, Hybrid, etc. However, and for the avoidance
          of doubt, only one type of Commission Structure for the same product
          may be applied at the same time. Therefore, once an Affiliate accepts
          Bigbettyâs offer to apply a new commission structure, different to the
          standard Commission Structure detailed in the Affiliate Agreement, the
          Affiliate hereby agrees and understands that the new proposed
          commission structure shall replace his existing commission structure
          in its entirety. Notwithstanding the above, the Affiliateâs
          obligations assumed under the Affiliate Agreement will still continue
          to apply to the Affiliate even if a new commission structure is
          applicable.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.7 If you select a Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) Payment Bigbetty shall
          pay you the selected payment or current standard payment which is
          payable in accordance with the preliminary agreed terms. You shall be
          entitled to a one-off commission based on a number of new depositing
          players directed to our brands who have successfully met minimum
          deposit, wagering and/or other requirements as per prior agreement.
          These amounts are at the discretion of Bigbetty and we reserve the
          right to change these amounts with prior written notice at any time.
          All CPA deals are subject to a 24-Hour termination policy. Bigbetty
          decision with regards to this will be considered final and no further
          correspondence will be entered into. Right of admission to the CPA
          Program will be reserved at all times and for any reason. If we
          determine, in our sole discretion, that you are enrolled in the CPA
          Program to benefit from it by referring players that we deem not
          legitimately interested in our products or services or of a similar
          average value to our current players, we reserve the right to
          terminate your participation in the Program with immediate effect.
          Should this occur, from the moment of your notification, your CPA
          payment generated on existing or new referred players will be
          forfeited and considered null and void with no further correspondence
          entered into.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.8 If you select a Hybrid Payment Bigbetty shall pay you: The
          selected hybrid CPA payments payable in accordance with the
          preliminary agreed terms; The selected âRevenue Shareâ percentages of
          Net Casino for as long as each Customer has an account with Bigbetty
          brands.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.9 The Affiliateâs acceptance of the payment of the Commission shall
          be deemed to constitute the full and final settlement of the balance
          due for the relevant period.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.10 If either Party disagrees with the balance due, it shall notify
          the other Party within fifteen (15) days and state the reasons of the
          disagreement. The disputed amount shall then be compared by Bigbetty
          to reports offered in the Bigbetty Affiliate Account system and the
          Bigbetty database, and the final amount payable shall be as per the
          figure reported on the database.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.11 The Affiliate shall have the sole responsibility to pay any and
          all taxes, levies, fees, charges and any other money payable or due
          both locally and abroad (if any) to any tax authority, department or
          other competent entity as a result of the compensation generated under
          the Affiliate Agreement. Bigbetty shall under no circumstances
          whatsoever be held liable for any such amounts unpaid but found to be
          due by the Affiliate and the Affiliate shall indemnify Bigbetty in
          that regard.

        <p>6.12 High-Roller policy</p>

        <p>
          6.12.1 In any given month, if a Customer generates a negative Net
          Revenue* of at least 10,000 Eur, he/she will be deemed to be, for the
          purposes of this section, a 'High roller(s)'.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.12.2 If the Aggregate Net Revenue for the Affiliate account, in that
          month, for a Brand is negative 10,000 Eur or greater, then the High
          roller(s) policy as set out hereunder, will apply:
        </p>

        <p>
          6.12.2.1 The negative balance carried forward cannot be greater than
          the total aggregate negative Net revenue for the Affiliate account,
          for that month;
        </p>

        <p>
          6.12.2.2 The negative balance carried forward that was generated by
          the High roller(s) cannot be set-off against other Customersâ future
          positive Net Revenue;
        </p>

        <p>
          6.12.2.3 The negative balance that is carried forward will be reduced
          by future positive Net Revenue that High roller(s) generate in
          subsequent months;
        </p>

        <p>
          6.12.2.4 A negative balance of the High roller(s) will not be
          increased by future negative Net Revenue unless the High roller(s)
          meets the qualifying criteria in subsequent months;
        </p>

        <p>
          6.12.2.5 If there is more than one High Roller in that month, the
          negative balance carried forward will be split proportionally between
          them;
        </p>

        <p>
          6.12.2.6 Positive Net Revenue generated by the High Roller(s) in the
          following months will not be included in the calculation of an
          aggregate Net Revenue until it fully offsets the negative High
          Roller(s) balance.
        </p>

        <h2>7. MODIFICATION OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
        <p>

          is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate the
          Affiliate Agreement. Your continue participation in our Affiliate
          Program following our posting of a change notice or new agreement on
          our site will constitute binding acceptance of the modification or of

        </p>

        <h2>8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY</h2>
        <p>

          of any such confidential information to third persons or outside
          parties unless you have our prior written consent. You also agree that
          you will use the confidential information only for purposes necessary
          to further the purposes of the Affiliate Agreement. Your obligations
          in regards to this clause survive the termination of the Affiliate
          Agreement. You must not issue any press release or similar
          communication to the public with respect to your participation in the
          Affiliate Program without the prior written consent of Bigbetty (with

          approved as an Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, Bigbetty may

        <p>
          9.2. Termination upon Bigbetty Affiliate Program. The agreement can be
          terminated under the following circumstances: Fraud (i.e
          multi-accounts, creation of fake user accounts and/or imitation of
          players gaming activity, non-typically large percentage of players who
          do not return to the project, etc.) In case of Fraud, Affiliate
          Program stops all the promo campaigns with an Affiliate immediately
          and blocks Affiliate account due to this cause for an unlimited period
          after detection of the fraudulent activity. Affiliate balance and
          outstanding commission is subject to cancellation. Incentive traffic
          (Affiliate uses any type of motivation to lure players to make a
          deposit without prior agreement and approval by the Affiliate Program,
          i.e. cashbacks, prize draws, giveaways etc.) In case of detecting the
          usage of any types of unauthorized incentives, Affiliate Program stops
          all the promo campaigns with an Affiliate immediately and blocks
          Affiliate account due to this cause for an unlimited period after
          detection of such activity. Affiliate balance and outstanding
          commission is subject to cancellation. Traffic low quality (i.e.
          abnormal percentage of bonus hunters, low revenue by player etc.) In
          case of traffic low quality, Affiliate Program informs Affiliate about
          the termination of the CPA/Hybrid agreement the day before
          termination. If the Affiliate does not answer, the income of the
          partner (i. e. payments for the New Depositing players that came after
          termination) will be recalculated according to the terms of Revenue
          Share commission model. All the CPA commission generated by the
          activity of the organized group of Bonus Hunters who came through
          affiliate tracking link, is subject to cancellation.
